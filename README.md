# Google-Minesweeper-Solver
Algorithm written in python with a friend to teach him programming. 

Fastest time gotten on medium difficulty was 9 seconds, faster than any human

Scores world-record pace regularly

10 second game (on par with human world record): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dl0QC8vMM9pwb1-F0-AZQmDKglP0APf2/view?usp=sharing 

This algorithm is slow because it's written in python and requires reading screen data to function, but if applied to an in-built minesweeper program, could likely solve the board in a few seconds.
